Description: A comprehensive set of interactive statistical data visualization tools built as a wrapper for 
    'ggstatsplot'. The package provides a graphical user interface in 'jamovi' for creating informative 
    publication-ready plots that combine statistical analysis results with data visualization. Supports 
    various plot types including bar charts, violin plots, correlation matrices, scatter plots, dot plots, 
    histograms and pie charts, with automatic statistical test selection and reporting. Offers features for 
    both between-group and within-group comparisons, pairwise tests, effect size calculations, and Bayesian 
    analysis options.
