# Getting Started

## Installation Requirements

The Economist-style plots require the `ggeconodist` package for optimal functionality:

```r
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("ggeconodist")

# Or install from GitHub for latest features
remotes::install_github("hrbrmstr/ggeconodist")

# Alternative repository
install.packages("ggeconodist", repos = "https://cinc.rud.is")
```

## Font Requirements

For authentic Economist styling, install recommended fonts:

### **Optimal Fonts (Recommended)**
- **ITC Officina Sans**: The Economist's primary font (commercial license required)
- **IBM Plex Sans**: Excellent free alternative from Google Fonts
- **Verdana**: High-quality substitute, usually pre-installed

### **Acceptable Fallbacks**
- **Arial/Helvetica**: Standard system fonts that work well
- **System Sans**: Default fonts that ensure compatibility

**Note**: The module automatically detects and uses the best available font, providing installation guidance when optimal fonts aren't found.

# Clinical Research Applications

## Understanding Distribution Characteristics

Economist-style distribution plots excel at revealing:

### **Treatment Response Patterns**
- Comparison of outcome distributions across treatment groups
- Identification of treatment response heterogeneity
- Visualization of therapeutic windows and optimal dosing ranges

### **Biomarker Analysis**
- Distribution of biomarker values across patient subpopulations
- Identification of diagnostic thresholds and reference ranges
- Comparison of biomarker performance across different assays

### **Healthcare Economics**
- Cost distribution analysis across institutions or regions
- Resource utilization patterns and efficiency comparisons
- Quality metric distributions showing performance variation

### **Population Health Studies**
- Age-specific disease prevalence distributions
- Geographic variation in health outcomes
- Temporal trends in epidemiological indicators

# Practical Examples

## Example 1: Treatment Outcome Distribution Analysis

This example demonstrates comparing treatment outcomes between groups using the histopathology dataset:

```r
library(jjstatsplot)

# Load the histopathology dataset
data("histopathology")

# Basic Economist-style distribution plot
# Comparing overall survival time by treatment group
economistplots(
  data = histopathology,
  y_var = "OverallTime",
  x_var = "Group",
  plot_title = "Treatment Response Distribution Analysis",
  x_title = "Treatment Group",
  y_title = "Overall Survival Time (months)",
  caption_text = "Source: Histopathology study (n=250)",
  economist_theme = TRUE,
  show_legend = TRUE,
  add_statistics = TRUE,
  stat_method = "anova",
  effect_size = TRUE
)
```

**Clinical Interpretation:**
- The 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles are clearly highlighted
- Statistical comparison automatically included
- Effect size calculation provides clinical significance context
- Compact design suitable for publication

## Example 2: Biomarker Distribution by Disease Status

Analyzing biomarker distributions across disease groups:

```r
# Compare measurement distributions by disease status
economistplots(
  data = histopathology,
  y_var = "MeasurementA",
  x_var = "Disease Status",
  facet_var = "Sex",
  plot_title = "Biomarker A Distribution by Disease Status",
  x_title = "Disease Status",
  y_title = "Biomarker A Level",
  caption_text = "Faceted by patient sex",
  distribution_style = "enhanced",
  show_points = TRUE,
  point_jitter = 0.15,
  add_statistics = TRUE,
  stat_method = "kruskal",
  summary_statistics = TRUE
)
```

**Key Features:**
- Faceting allows subgroup analysis by sex
- Non-parametric statistical testing for non-normal distributions
- Individual points overlay for detailed data exploration
- Comprehensive summary statistics included

## Example 3: Multi-Group Age Distribution Analysis

Examining age distributions across multiple clinical categories:

```r
# Age distribution across mortality groups
economistplots(
  data = histopathology,
  y_var = "Age",
  x_var = "Mortality5yr",
  color_var = "Grade_Level",
  plot_title = "Age Distribution by 5-Year Mortality",
  x_title = "5-Year Mortality Status",
  y_title = "Patient Age (years)",
  caption_text = "Colored by tumor grade level",
  distribution_style = "publication",
  percentile_colors = TRUE,
  tenth_color = "#c7254e",
  median_color = "#2c3e50",
  ninetieth_color = "#18bc9c",
  alpha_level = 0.8,
