# Introduction

The `classification` function in ClinicoPath provides comprehensive machine learning capabilities for clinical and pathological research. This tool enables researchers to build predictive models for medical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response using various state-of-the-art algorithms.

## Clinical Motivation

Machine learning classification is crucial in modern medical research for:

- **Diagnostic Support**: Automated diagnosis from pathological features
- **Risk Stratification**: Patient classification into risk categories
- **Treatment Selection**: Personalized medicine approaches
- **Biomarker Discovery**: Identifying predictive molecular signatures
- **Outcome Prediction**: Prognosis and survival classification
- **Quality Control**: Automated detection of quality issues

Classification algorithms help clinicians make data-driven decisions by identifying complex patterns in medical data that may not be apparent through traditional statistical methods.

## Package Setup

```{r setup 2}
library(jjstatsplot)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

# Load the breast cancer dataset
data("BreastCancer")

# Display dataset structure
cat("BreastCancer dataset structure:\\n")
str(BreastCancer)
cat("\\nClass distribution:\\n")
table(BreastCancer$Class)
```

# Basic Classification Analysis

## Example 1: Decision Tree Classification

Let's start with a basic decision tree for breast cancer diagnosis:

```{r basic-decision-tree, eval=FALSE}
# Basic decision tree classification
# Note: Function available in jamovi interface
classification(
  data = BreastCancer,
  dep = "Class",
  indep = c("Cl.thickness", "Cell.size", "Cell.shape", "Marg.adhesion"),
  classifier = "singleDecisionTree",
  testing = "split",
  testSize = 0.3,
  complexity = 0.01,
  maxDepth = 10,
  reporting = c("confusionMatrix", "classifMetrices")
)
```

### Interpretation

The results show:
- **Confusion Matrix**: Actual vs. predicted classifications
- **Accuracy**: Overall prediction accuracy
- **Precision/Recall**: Per-class performance metrics
- **Tree Structure**: Decision rules for interpretation

## Example 2: Random Forest Classification

Building an ensemble model for improved accuracy:

```{r random-forest, eval=FALSE}
# Random forest classification
classification(
  data = BreastCancer,
  dep = "Class",
  indep = c("Cl.thickness", "Cell.size", "Cell.shape", "Marg.adhesion", 
            "Epith.c.size", "Bare.nuclei"),
  classifier = "randomForest",
  testing = "crossValidation",
  noOfFolds = 10,
  noOfTrees = 100,
  sampleFraction = 0.8,
  splitRule = "gini",
  reporting = c("confusionMatrix", "classifMetrices", "AUC"),
  printRandForest = TRUE
)
```

### Clinical Significance

Random forests provide:
- Higher accuracy through ensemble averaging
- Feature importance rankings
- Robust performance across different datasets
- Reduced overfitting compared to single trees

# Advanced Classification Methods

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

For similarity-based classification:

```{r knn-classification, eval=FALSE}
# KNN classification with different distance metrics
classification(
  data = BreastCancer,
  dep = "Class",
  indep = c("Cl.thickness", "Cell.size", "Cell.shape"),
  classifier = "knn",
  knnNeighbors = 5,
  knnDistance = "euclidean",
  testing = "split",
  testSize = 0.25,
  reporting = c("confusionMatrix", "AUC")
)
```

### Distance Metrics Comparison

```{r knn-distance-comparison, eval=FALSE}
# Compare different distance metrics
distance_metrics <- c("euclidean", "manhattan", "minkowski")

for (metric in distance_metrics) {
  cat(paste0("\\n", metric, " Distance Metric:\\n"))
  classification(
    data = BreastCancer,
    dep = "Class",
    indep = c("Cl.thickness", "Cell.size", "Cell.shape"),
    classifier = "knn",
    knnNeighbors = 5,
    knnDistance = metric,
    testing = "split",
    testSize = 0.25
  )
}
```

## Support Vector Machines (SVM)

For complex decision boundaries:

```{r svm-classification, eval=FALSE}
# SVM with radial basis function kernel
classification(
  data = BreastCancer,
  dep = "Class",
  indep = c("Cl.thickness", "Cell.size", "Cell.shape", "Marg.adhesion"),
  classifier = "svm",
  svmKernel = "radial",
  svmCost = 1.0,
  svmGamma = 1.0,
  testing = "crossValidation",
  noOfFolds = 5,
  reporting = c("confusionMatrix", "classifMetrices", "AUC")
)
```

### Kernel Comparison

```{r svm-kernel-comparison, eval=FALSE}
# Compare different SVM kernels
svm_kernels <- c("linear", "radial", "polynomial")

for (kernel in svm_kernels) {
  cat(paste0("\\n", kernel, " Kernel:\\n"))
  classification(
    data = BreastCancer,
    dep = "Class",
    indep = c("Cl.thickness", "Cell.size", "Cell.shape"),
    classifier = "svm",
    svmKernel = kernel,
    svmCost = 1.0,
    svmGamma = 1.0,
    testing = "split"
  )
}
```

# Clinical Performance Metrics

## Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation

For medical applications, clinical metrics are essential:

```{r clinical-metrics, eval=FALSE}
# Classification with clinical performance metrics
classification(
  data = BreastCancer,
  dep = "Class",
  indep = c("Cl.thickness", "Cell.size", "Cell.shape", "Marg.adhesion"),
  classifier = "randomForest",
  testing = "crossValidation",
  noOfFolds = 10,
  reportClinicalMetrics = TRUE,
  reportConfidenceIntervals = TRUE,
  bootstrapSamples = 1000,
  reporting = c("confusionMatrix", "classifMetrices", "AUC")
)
```

### Clinical Metrics Interpretation

**Sensitivity (True Positive Rate)**:
- Proportion of actual positives correctly identified
- Critical for screening: high sensitivity minimizes false negatives

**Specificity (True Negative Rate)**:
- Proportion of actual negatives correctly identified
- Important for confirmatory tests: high specificity minimizes false positives

**Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**:
- Probability that positive result is truly positive
- Depends on disease prevalence and test characteristics

**Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**:
- Probability that negative result is truly negative
- High NPV important for ruling out disease

**Likelihood Ratios**:
- Positive LR: How much positive test increases disease odds
- Negative LR: How much negative test decreases disease odds

## Confidence Intervals for Clinical Metrics

```{r confidence-intervals, eval=FALSE}
# Bootstrap confidence intervals for clinical metrics
classification(
  data = BreastCancer,
  dep = "Class",
  indep = c("Cl.thickness", "Cell.size", "Cell.shape"),
  classifier = "singleDecisionTree",
  testing = "split",
  testSize = 0.3,
  reportClinicalMetrics = TRUE,
  reportConfidenceIntervals = TRUE,
  bootstrapSamples = 1000
)
```

# Class Imbalance Handling

## Addressing Imbalanced Datasets

Medical datasets often have class imbalance:

```{r class-imbalance-upsample, eval=FALSE}
# Handle class imbalance with upsampling
classification(
  data = BreastCancer,
  dep = "Class",
  indep = c("Cl.thickness", "Cell.size", "Cell.shape"),
  classifier = "randomForest",
  balancingMethod = "upsample",
  testing = "crossValidation",
  noOfFolds = 5,
  reportClinicalMetrics = TRUE
)
```

```{r class-imbalance-downsample, eval=FALSE}
# Handle class imbalance with downsampling
classification(
  data = BreastCancer,
  dep = "Class",
  indep = c("Cl.thickness", "Cell.size", "Cell.shape"),
  classifier = "randomForest",
  balancingMethod = "downsample",
  testing = "crossValidation",
  noOfFolds = 5,
  reportClinicalMetrics = TRUE
)
```

### Balancing Method Selection

**Upsampling**:
- Replicates minority class samples
- Preserves all original data
- Risk of overfitting minority class

**Downsampling**:
- Reduces majority class samples
- Balanced training set
- Loss of potentially useful data

**SMOTE** (Future implementation):
- Generates synthetic minority samples
- More sophisticated than simple replication
- Better generalization

# Validation Strategies

  classifier = "randomForest",
  testing = "crossValidation",
  noOfFolds = 10,
  reportClinicalMetrics = TRUE,
  reportConfidenceIntervals = TRUE,
  bootstrapSamples = 500
)
```

  classifier = "singleDecisionTree",
  validateMethod = "bootstrap",
  bootstrapSamples = 1000,
  reportClinicalMetrics = TRUE,
  reportConfidenceIntervals = TRUE
)
```

## Holdout Validation

```{r holdout-validation, eval=FALSE}
# Simple train-test split validation
classification(
  data = BreastCancer,
  dep = "Class",
  indep = c("Cl.thickness", "Cell.size", "Cell.shape"),
  classifier = "logisticRegression",
  validateMethod = "holdout",
  testSize = 0.3,

  cat(paste0("Algorithm: ", algorithm, "\\n"))
  
  result <- classification(
    data = BreastCancer,
    dep = "Class",
    indep = c("Cl.thickness", "Cell.size", "Cell.shape", "Marg.adhesion"),
    classifier = algorithm,
    testing = "crossValidation",
    noOfFolds = 5,
    reportClinicalMetrics = TRUE,
    knnNeighbors = if(algorithm == "knn") 5 else 5,  # Default for non-KNN
    noOfTrees = if(algorithm == "randomForest") 50 else 10  # Default for non-RF
  )
  
  cat("\\n")
}
```

## Feature Selection Impact

```{r feature-selection, eval=FALSE}

  "Basic" = c("Cl.thickness", "Cell.size"),
  "Extended" = c("Cl.thickness", "Cell.size", "Cell.shape", "Marg.adhesion"),
  "Comprehensive" = c("Cl.thickness", "Cell.size", "Cell.shape", "Marg.adhesion", 
                     "Epith.c.size", "Bare.nuclei", "Bl.cromatin")
)

for (set_name in names(feature_sets)) {
  cat(paste0("\\nFeature Set: ", set_name, "\\n"))
  
  classification(
    data = BreastCancer,
    dep = "Class",
    indep = feature_sets[[set_name]],
    classifier = "randomForest",
    testing = "crossValidation",
    noOfFolds = 5,
    reportClinicalMetrics = TRUE
  )
}
```

# Clinical Decision Thresholds

## Optimizing Clinical Cutoffs

```{r clinical-cutoffs, eval=FALSE}
# Test different clinical decision thresholds
cutoff_values <- c(0.3, 0.5, 0.7)

cat("Clinical Cutoff Optimization:\\n\\n")

for (cutoff in cutoff_values) {
  cat(paste0("Clinical Cutoff: ", cutoff, "\\n"))
  
  classification(
    data = BreastCancer,
    dep = "Class",
    indep = c("Cl.thickness", "Cell.size", "Cell.shape"),
    classifier = "randomForest",
    clinicalCutoff = cutoff,
    testing = "split",
    testSize = 0.3,
    reportClinicalMetrics = TRUE
  )
  
  cat("\\n")
}
```

### Cutoff Selection Guidelines

- **Low Cutoff (0.3)**: High sensitivity, more screening
