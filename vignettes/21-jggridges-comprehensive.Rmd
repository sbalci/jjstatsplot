# Introduction

The `jggridges` function provides comprehensive ridge plot visualization capabilities for comparing distributions across multiple groups. Ridge plots (also known as joy plots) are particularly effective for visualizing the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories, making them ideal for clinical research applications.

Ridge plots are superior to traditional methods like box plots or violin plots when:

- **Multiple Groups**: You need to compare distributions across many groups (>5)
- **Distribution Shape**: The shape of the distribution is important, not just summary statistics
- **Space Efficiency**: You need to display many distributions in a compact format
- **Pattern Recognition**: You want to identify trends or patterns across ordered categories
- **Visual Appeal**: You need publication-quality, aesthetically pleasing visualizations

# Key Features

The `jggridges` function supports:

- **Multiple Plot Types**: Basic ridgelines, density ridges, gradient density ridges, and violin ridges
- **Flexible Aesthetics**: Customizable colors, transparency, and scaling
- **Statistical Overlays**: Quantile lines, mean lines, and jittered data points
- **Advanced Options**: Multiple bandwidth methods, theme styles, and faceting
- **Statistical Output**: Summary statistics and interpretations for each group
- **Publication Ready**: Professional themes and customizable labels

# Basic Ridge Plots

## Simple Distribution Comparison

Let's start with a basic ridge plot comparing age distributions across tumor grades:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load histopathology data
data(histopathology, package = "ClinicoPath")

# Basic ridge plot of age by tumor grade
basic_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = histopathology,
  x_var = "Age",
  y_var = "Grade_Level",
  plot_type = "density_ridges",
  plot_title = "Age Distribution by Tumor Grade",
  x_label = "Age (years)",
  y_label = "Tumor Grade"
)

# The plot will be displayed in jamovi interface
```

## Understanding the Output

Ridge plots display:
- **X-axis**: The continuous variable being analyzed
- **Y-axis**: Categories or groups for comparison
- **Ridge Height**: Probability density at each point
- **Overlap**: Shows how distributions overlap between groups

# Plot Types

## Density Ridges

The most common type, showing smooth density estimates:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Density ridges with custom scaling
density_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = histopathology,
  x_var = "Age",
  y_var = "Grade_Level",
  plot_type = "density_ridges",
  scale = 1.5,  # Increase ridge height
  alpha = 0.8,  # Slight transparency
  plot_title = "Density Ridge Plot of Age by Grade"
)
```

## Gradient Density Ridges

Add color gradients to show density variation:

```{r}
# Gradient density ridges
gradient_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = histopathology,
  x_var = "MeasurementA",
  y_var = "TStage",
  plot_type = "density_ridges_gradient",
  color_palette = "viridis",
  plot_title = "Gradient Ridge Plot: Biomarker A by T-Stage"
)
```

## Basic Ridgelines

For pre-computed densities or simple line plots:

```{r}
# Basic ridgeline plot
ridgeline <- jggridges(
  data = histopathology,
  x_var = "Age",
  y_var = "Grade_Level",
  plot_type = "ridgeline",
  plot_title = "Basic Ridgeline Plot"
)
```

## Violin Ridges

Combination of ridge plots and violin plots:

```{r}
# Density ridge plot (violin_ridges not available in ggridges)
density_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = histopathology,
  x_var = "OverallTime",
  y_var = "Group",
  plot_type = "density_ridges",
  plot_title = "Density Ridge Plot: Survival Time by Treatment Group"
)
```

# Statistical Overlays

## Quantile Lines

Show specific quantiles within each distribution:

```{r}
# Ridge plot with quantile lines
quantile_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = histopathology,
  x_var = "Age",
  y_var = "Grade_Level",
  plot_type = "density_ridges",
  quantile_lines = TRUE,
  quantiles = "0.25, 0.5, 0.75",
  plot_title = "Age Distribution with Quartiles"
)
```

## Mean Lines

Add vertical lines showing group means:

```{r}
# Ridge plot with mean lines
mean_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = histopathology,
  x_var = "MeasurementB",
  y_var = "Grade_Level",
  plot_type = "density_ridges",
  show_mean = TRUE,
  plot_title = "Biomarker B Distribution with Mean Lines"
)
```

## Jittered Points

Show individual data points below ridges:

```{r}
# Ridge plot with jittered points (raincloud style)
points_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = histopathology[sample(nrow(histopathology), 100), ],  # Subset for clarity
  x_var = "Age",
  y_var = "Sex",
  plot_type = "density_ridges",
  jittered_points = TRUE,
  point_alpha = 0.4,
  plot_title = "Age Distribution by Sex with Raw Data"
)
```

# Aesthetic Customization

## Color Variables

Use a third variable to color ridges:

```{r}
# Ridge plot with color mapping
color_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = histopathology,
  x_var = "Age",
  y_var = "TStage",
  color_var = "LVI",
  color_palette = "Set1",
  plot_type = "density_ridges",
  plot_title = "Age by T-Stage, Colored by LVI Status"
)
```

## Scale and Transparency

Control ridge height and opacity:

```{r}
# Customized scale and transparency
custom_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = histopathology,
  x_var = "Age",
  y_var = "Grade_Level",
  scale = 2.0,      # Double the ridge height
  alpha = 0.6,      # 60% opacity
  rel_min_height = 0.02,  # Minimum height threshold
  plot_title = "Customized Ridge Heights and Transparency"
)
```

## Theme Styles

Apply different ggplot2 themes:

```{r}
# Ridge plot with minimal theme
minimal_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = histopathology,
  x_var = "Age",
  y_var = "Grade_Level",
  theme_style = "theme_minimal",
  plot_title = "Minimal Theme Ridge Plot"
)

# Ridge plot with classic theme
classic_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = histopathology,
  x_var = "Age",
  y_var = "Grade_Level",
  theme_style = "theme_classic",
  plot_title = "Classic Theme Ridge Plot"
)
```

# Advanced Features

bandwidth_methods <- c("nrd0", "nrd", "ucv", "SJ")

for (method in bandwidth_methods) {
  ridge_plot <- jggridges(
    data = histopathology,
    x_var = "Age",
    y_var = "Grade_Level",
    plot_type = "density_ridges",
    bandwidth = method,
    plot_title = paste("Bandwidth Method:", method)
  )
}
```

## Faceting

Create separate panels for subgroups:

```{r}
# Faceted ridge plot
facet_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = histopathology,
  x_var = "Age",
  y_var = "Grade_Level",
  facet_var = "Sex",
  plot_type = "density_ridges",
  plot_title = "Age Distribution by Grade, Faceted by Sex"
)
```

## Reverse Order

```{r}
# Reversed order ridge plot
reverse_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = histopathology,
  x_var = "Age",
  y_var = "Grade_Level",
  reverse_order = TRUE,
  plot_title = "Reversed Order: Low Grade at Top"
)
```

```

## ColorBrewer Palettes

Qualitative color schemes for categorical data:

```{r}
# ColorBrewer palette examples
brewer_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = histopathology,
  x_var = "Age",
  y_var = "Grade_Level",
  color_var = "Sex",
  color_palette = "Set2",
  plot_type = "density_ridges",
  plot_title = "ColorBrewer Set2 Palette"
)
```

# Statistical Analysis

## Summary Statistics

Generate detailed statistics for each group:

```{r}
# Ridge plot with statistics
stats_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = histopathology,
  x_var = "Age",
  y_var = "Grade_Level",
  plot_type = "density_ridges",
  show_statistics = TRUE,
  show_interpretation = TRUE,
  plot_title = "Age Distribution with Statistical Summary"
)

# Statistics table includes:
# - N (sample size)
# - Mean and SD
# - Median and quartiles
# - Min and Max values
```

## Interpretation Output

Get automated interpretation of results:

# Ridge plot with interpretation
interpret_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = histopathology,
  x_var = "MeasurementA",
  y_var = "TStage",
  show_interpretation = TRUE,
  plot_title = "Biomarker Analysis with Interpretation"
)

# Interpretation includes:
# - Dataset overview
# - Overall distribution characteristics
# - Group comparisons
# - Visual insights
```

# Best Practices

## Data Preparation

1. **Check Data Types**: Ensure X variable is numeric and Y variable is categorical
2. **Handle Missing Data**: Function removes incomplete cases automatically
3. **Group Sizes**: Ensure adequate sample size per group (n > 10 recommended)
4. **Outliers**: Consider impact on density estimation

## Visual Design

1. **Scale Selection**: 
   - Use scale = 1.0 for minimal overlap
   - Use scale > 1.5 for emphasized differences
   - Use scale < 1.0 for many groups

2. **Color Choice**:
   - Use gradient for continuous density representation
   - Use categorical colors for group comparisons
   - Consider colorblind-friendly palettes

3. **Label Clarity**:
   - Use descriptive axis labels
   - Add informative titles and subtitles
   - Consider rotating long group labels

## Statistical Considerations

1. **Bandwidth Selection**:
   - "nrd0" (default): Good general purpose
   - "SJ": Better for multimodal distributions
   - "ucv": Unbiased cross-validation

2. **Quantile Display**:
   - Show median (0.5) for central tendency
   - Show quartiles (0.25, 0.75) for spread
   - Consider deciles for detailed analysis

# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### Too Many Groups
```r
# If you have many groups, adjust scale and consider ordering
many_groups_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = data_with_many_groups,
  x_var = "value",
  y_var = "group",
  scale = 0.9,  # Reduce overlap
  rel_min_height = 0.01,  # Show smaller ridges
  expand_panel = FALSE  # Compact display
)
```

### Sparse Data
```r
# For sparse data, adjust bandwidth
sparse_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = sparse_data,
  x_var = "value",
  y_var = "group",
  bandwidth = "SJ",  # Adaptive bandwidth
  plot_type = "density_ridges"
)
```

### Overlapping Labels
```r
# Handle overlapping Y-axis labels
label_ridge <- jggridges(
  data = histopathology,
  x_var = "Age",
  y_var = "Grade_Level",
  theme_style = "theme_minimal",
  expand_panel = TRUE
)
```
