## When to Use jjbetweenstats

Use `jjbetweenstats` when you need to:

- Analyze treatment effects in clinical trials
- Examine biomarker expression across conditions
- Perform pharmacokinetic comparisons
- Evaluate psychological intervention outcomes
- Create publication-ready statistical visualizations

# Basic Usage

## Single Dependent Variable Analysis

Let's start with a basic example using clinical laboratory data:

```{r basic-example}
# Basic violin plot comparing hemoglobin levels across treatment groups
jjbetweenstats(
  data = clinical_lab_data,
  dep = hemoglobin,
  group = treatment_group,
  grvar = NULL
)
```

This creates a violin plot showing the distribution of hemoglobin levels across different treatment groups, complete with appropriate statistical testing and effect size calculations.

## Multiple Dependent Variables

The optimized function efficiently handles multiple dependent variables:

```{r multiple-deps}
# Analyze multiple lab parameters simultaneously
jjbetweenstats(
  data = clinical_lab_data,
  dep = c(hemoglobin, white_blood_cells, platelet_count),
  group = treatment_group,
  grvar = NULL
)
```

# Advanced Statistical Options

## Statistical Methods Comparison

The function supports four different statistical approaches:

### Parametric Analysis (Default)
```{r parametric}
jjbetweenstats(
  data = biomarker_expression_data,
  dep = protein_a_expression,
  group = tissue_type,
  typestatistics = "parametric"
)
```

### Non-parametric Analysis
```{r nonparametric}
jjbetweenstats(
  data = pharmacokinetics_data,
  dep = peak_concentration,
  group = dose_level,
  typestatistics = "nonparametric"
)
```

### Robust Analysis
```{r robust}
jjbetweenstats(
  data = psychological_assessment_data,
  dep = quality_of_life,
  group = intervention_group,
  typestatistics = "robust"
)
```

### Bayesian Analysis
```{r bayesian}
jjbetweenstats(
  data = exercise_physiology_data,
  dep = vo2_max,
  group = training_regimen,
  typestatistics = "bayes"
)
```

# Grouped Analysis with Performance Benefits

## Using the grvar Parameter

The optimized `grvar` parameter allows for sophisticated grouped analyses:

```{r grouped-analysis}
# Analyze hemoglobin by treatment group, split by disease severity
jjbetweenstats(
  data = clinical_lab_data,
  dep = hemoglobin,
  group = treatment_group,
  grvar = disease_severity
)
```

## Complex Multi-level Grouping

```{r complex-grouped}
# Biomarker expression by tissue type, grouped by tumor grade
jjbetweenstats(
  data = biomarker_expression_data,
  dep = protein_a_expression,
  group = tissue_type,
  grvar = tumor_grade
)
```

# Pairwise Comparisons and Effect Sizes

## Enabling Pairwise Comparisons

When comparing multiple groups, pairwise comparisons provide detailed insights:

```{r pairwise-comparisons}
jjbetweenstats(
  data = pharmacokinetics_data,
  dep = peak_concentration,
  group = dose_level,
  pairwisecomparisons = TRUE,
  padjustmethod = "holm"
)
```

## Effect Size Options

# Cohen's d (biased) for clinical trials
jjbetweenstats(
  data = clinical_lab_data,
  dep = creatinine,
  group = treatment_group,
  effsizetype = "biased"
)
```

```{r hedges-g}
# Hedge's g (unbiased) for smaller samples
jjbetweenstats(
  data = psychological_assessment_data,
  dep = depression_score,
  group = intervention_group,
  effsizetype = "unbiased"
)
```

jjbetweenstats(
  data = histopathology,
  dep = Age,
  group = Sex,
  typestatistics = "nonparametric"
)
```

```{r histopathology-multiple}
# Multiple measurements analysis
jjbetweenstats(
  data = histopathology,
  dep = c(Age, Grade),
  group = Group,
  typestatistics = "robust"
)
```

# Performance Benchmarking

## Large Dataset Handling

The optimized function efficiently handles large datasets:

```{r large-dataset, eval=FALSE}
# Create larger dataset for demonstration
large_clinical_data <- do.call(rbind, replicate(10, clinical_lab_data, simplify = FALSE))
large_clinical_data$patient_id <- 1:nrow(large_clinical_data)

# Performance optimizations make this efficient
jjbetweenstats(
  data = large_clinical_data,
  dep = c(hemoglobin, white_blood_cells, platelet_count),
  group = treatment_group,
  grvar = disease_severity
)
```

## Caching Benefits

The function's caching system provides significant performance improvements:

- **Data Processing Cache**: Eliminates redundant data conversions
- **Options Cache**: Prevents repeated formula construction
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduces memory footprint for large analyses

# Advanced Configuration Options

## Multiple Comparison Corrections

Choose appropriate correction methods:

```{r bonferroni}
# Conservative Bonferroni correction
jjbetweenstats(
  data = pharmacokinetics_data,
  dep = clearance_rate,
  group = dose_level,
  pairwisecomparisons = TRUE,
  padjustmethod = "bonferroni"
)
```

```{r fdr}
# False Discovery Rate control
jjbetweenstats(
  data = biomarker_expression_data,
  dep = protein_a_expression,
  group = tissue_type,
  pairwisecomparisons = TRUE,
  padjustmethod = "BH"
)
```

## Customizing Display Options

```{r display-options}
# Show all pairwise comparisons
jjbetweenstats(
  data = clinical_lab_data,
  dep = bilirubin,
  group = treatment_group,
  pairwisecomparisons = TRUE,
  pairwisedisplay = "everything"
)
```

```{r no-subtitle}
# Remove statistical subtitle for cleaner plots
jjbetweenstats(
  data = exercise_physiology_data,
  dep = flexibility_score,
  group = sport_type,
  resultssubtitle = FALSE
)
```

# Troubleshooting and Best Practices

## Handling Missing Data

The function automatically handles missing data through `jmvcore::naOmit()`:

```{r missing-data-demo}
# Create data with missing values for demonstration
demo_data <- clinical_lab_data
demo_data$hemoglobin[1:10] <- NA

jjbetweenstats(
  data = demo_data,
  dep = hemoglobin,
  group = treatment_group
)
```

## Optimal Statistical Method Selection

### Guidelines for Method Selection:

1. **Parametric**: Use when data is approximately normal and variances are equal
2. **Non-parametric**: Default choice for non-normal data or small samples
3. **Robust**: Good compromise when data has outliers
4. **Bayesian**: When you want to incorporate prior knowledge

## Performance Tips

### For Large Datasets:
- Use single dependent variables when possible
- Consider data sampling for exploratory analysis
- Utilize the caching system by avoiding parameter changes

### For Multiple Comparisons:
- Choose appropriate correction methods
- Consider the balance between Type I and Type II errors
- Use effect sizes alongside p-values

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Too Many Groups
```{r many-groups}
# When you have many groups, consider grouping or filtering
filtered_data <- clinical_lab_data %>%
  filter(treatment_group %in% c("Control", "Drug A"))

jjbetweenstats(
  data = filtered_data,
  dep = hemoglobin,
  group = treatment_group
)
```

### Issue 2: Extreme Outliers
```{r outliers-robust}
# Use robust methods for data with extreme outliers
jjbetweenstats(
  data = biomarker_expression_data,
  dep = protein_a_expression,
  group = tissue_type,
  typestatistics = "robust"
)
```

# Interpretation Guidelines

## Understanding the Statistical Output

1. **Main Test Results**: Displayed in the plot subtitle
2. **Effect Sizes**: Indicate practical significance
3. **Confidence Intervals**: Show precision of estimates
4. **Pairwise Comparisons**: Identify specific group differences

## Reporting Results

When reporting results from jjbetweenstats:

1. Specify the statistical test used
2. Report effect sizes and confidence intervals
3. Mention multiple comparison corrections if applicable
4. Include sample sizes for each group
5. Describe the visualization type (violin, box, points)

## Clinical vs Statistical Significance

- Effect sizes help determine clinical relevance
- Consider confidence intervals for precision
- Large effect sizes may be clinically meaningful even with non-significant p-values
- Small effect sizes may not be clinically relevant despite statistical significance
