## Overview

The `jjriverplot` function provides a comprehensive interface for creating river plots (alluvial diagrams), Sankey diagrams, and stream graphs to visualize flows, transitions, and pathways over time or between categories. This function is built on `ggplot2` and `ggalluvial`, offering multiple visualization styles with performance optimization through internal caching.

## Key Features

- **Multiple plot types**: Alluvial diagrams, Sankey diagrams, and stream graphs
- **Flexible data formats**: Supports both longitudinal (long) and cross-sectional (wide) data
- **Weight integration**: Stream widths can represent quantities like costs, counts, or frequencies
- **Rich customization**: Fill patterns, curve types, labeling options, and themes
- **Performance optimized**: Uses internal caching to eliminate redundant computations
- **Clinical research ready**: Designed for patient pathway and treatment flow analysis

## When to Use River Plots

River plots excel at visualizing:

- **Patient treatment pathways**: Response changes over time
- **Customer journey analysis**: Funnel progression and conversion flows
- **Educational progressions**: Student performance tracking through stages
- **Process flows**: Manufacturing, approval, or workflow stages
- **Market transitions**: Brand switching, category migration
- **Longitudinal studies**: Any categorical changes over time

## Data Requirements

### Data Formats

#### Long Format (Longitudinal Data)

```{r long-format-structure}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Structure for longitudinal river plots
# Required columns:
# - time: factor with ordered levels (e.g., "Baseline", "Month_3", "Month_6")
# - strata: factor with category levels (e.g., "Complete_Response", "Partial_Response")
# - Optional: weight (numeric), id (factor)

example_long <- data.frame(
  patient_id = rep(c("P001", "P002"), each = 3),
  timepoint = factor(rep(c("T1", "T2", "T3"), times = 2)),
  response = factor(c("Good", "Good", "Excellent", 
                     "Poor", "Fair", "Good")),
  cost = c(1000, 1200, 800, 1500, 1300, 1100)
)
```

#### Wide Format (Cross-Sectional Stages)

```{r wide-format-structure}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Structure for multi-stage river plots
# Required: multiple strata variables representing sequential stages
# Optional: weight variable, demographic variables

example_wide <- data.frame(
  id = paste0("ID", 1:100),
  stage1 = factor(sample(c("A", "B", "C"), 100, replace = TRUE)),
  stage2 = factor(sample(c("X", "Y", "Z"), 100, replace = TRUE)),
  stage3 = factor(sample(c("Success", "Failure"), 100, replace = TRUE)),
  total_value = runif(100, 100, 1000)
)
```

### Data Quality Requirements

```{r data-quality}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# For optimal river plots:
# 1. Adequate sample sizes (n > 50 recommended)
# 2. Reasonable number of categories (2-8 per variable)
# 3. Meaningful category names (not just codes)
# 4. Proper factor ordering for time variables
# 5. Complete cases (missing values are excluded)
```

## Best Practices

### Plot Type Selection

```{r plot-type-selection}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Use Alluvial plots when:
# - Tracking changes over time
# - Emphasizing flow continuity
# - Showing patient/customer journeys
# - Time points are clearly defined

# Use Sankey diagrams when:  
# - Analyzing process flows
# - Emphasizing directed flows
# - Decision tree visualization
# - Resource allocation analysis

# Use Stream graphs when:
# - Showing composition over time
# - Continuous time variable
# - Relative proportions important
# - Market share analysis
```

### Color and Fill Strategy

```{r color-strategy}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# fillType selection:
# - "first": Track where flows originated (good for source analysis)
# - "last": Track where flows end up (good for outcome analysis)  
# - "frequency": Emphasize major flows (good for identifying patterns)

# Examples:
# Treatment analysis: use "first" to track initial response groups
# Outcome analysis: use "last" to track final outcomes
# Process optimization: use "frequency" to identify bottlenecks
```

### Labeling and Clarity

```{r labeling-guidelines}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# For clear river plots:
# 1. Use meaningful variable names and category labels
# 2. Enable node labels for interpretation (labelNodes = TRUE)
# 3. Show counts for quantitative analysis (showCounts = TRUE)
# 4. Provide clear axis labels and titles
# 5. Consider legend positioning based on plot complexity

# Avoid overwhelming plots:
# - Limit to 6-8 categories per variable
# - Combine rare categories when appropriate
# - Use clear, contrasting colors
# - Consider split plots for complex data
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Subset Analysis

```{r subset-analysis}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Analyze specific subgroups for detailed insights
# Example: High-cost patients only
high_cost_patients <- jjriverplot_test_data_long[
  jjriverplot_test_data_long$treatment_cost > 5000, ]

high_cost_analysis <- jjriverplot(
  data = high_cost_patients,
  time = "timepoint",
  strata = "treatment_response",
  weight = "treatment_cost",
  plotType = "alluvial",
  mytitle = "High-Cost Patient Pathways"
)

# Example: By demographic groups
elderly_patients <- jjriverplot_test_data_long[
  jjriverplot_test_data_long$age_group == "75+", ]

elderly_analysis <- jjriverplot(
  data = elderly_patients,
  time = "timepoint", 
  strata = "treatment_response",
  plotType = "alluvial",
  mytitle = "Elderly Patient Treatment Pathways"
)
```

### Comparative Analysis

```{r comparative-analysis}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Compare different treatments side by side
treatment_groups <- c("Treatment_A", "Treatment_B")

for (treatment in treatment_groups) {
  subset_data <- jjriverplot_test_data_long[
    jjriverplot_test_data_long$treatment_arm == treatment, ]
  
  plot_result <- jjriverplot(
    data = subset_data,
    time = "timepoint",
    strata = "treatment_response", 
    plotType = "alluvial",
    mytitle = paste("Pathways for", treatment)
  )
  
  # Save or display each plot
  print(plot_result$plot)
}
```

### Quality Control Applications

```{r quality-control}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Multi-center consistency analysis
center_comparison <- function(center_id) {
  center_data <- jjriverplot_test_data_long[
    jjriverplot_test_data_long$hospital_center == center_id, ]
  
  jjriverplot(
    data = center_data,
    time = "timepoint",
    strata = "treatment_response",
    plotType = "alluvial",
    mytitle = paste("Treatment Patterns -", center_id),
    labelNodes = TRUE,
    showCounts = TRUE
  )
}

# Analyze each center
centers <- unique(jjriverplot_test_data_long$hospital_center)
center_plots <- lapply(centers[1:3], center_comparison)  # First 3 centers
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Data contains no (complete) rows"**
   - Check for missing values in required variables
   - Ensure factor variables have valid levels
   - Verify data filtering hasn't excluded all observations

2. **Empty or unexpected flows**
   - Check factor level definitions and ordering
   - Verify time variable is properly formatted
   - Ensure categories exist at multiple time points

3. **Overlapping labels**
   - Reduce number of categories through grouping
   - Disable labels (labelNodes = FALSE) for complex plots
   - Consider using counts instead of labels

4. **Poor flow visibility**
   - Adjust plot size settings
   - Use weight variable to emphasize important flows
   - Consider filtering to show only major pathways

### Error Handling

```{r error-handling}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Example error handling
tryCatch({
  result <- jjriverplot(
    data = my_data,
    time = "time_var",
    strata = "category_var",
    plotType = "alluvial"
  )
}, error = function(e) {
  message("Error in river plot: ", e$message)
  message("Check your data structure and variable types")
  
  # Diagnostic information
  cat("Data structure:\n")
  str(my_data)
  cat("\nTime variable levels:\n")
  print(levels(my_data$time_var))
  cat("\nCategory variable levels:\n")
  print(levels(my_data$category_var))
})
```

### Performance Considerations

```{r performance-tips}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# For large datasets:
# - Consider sampling for initial exploration
# - Group rare categories to reduce complexity
# - Use weight variables to highlight important flows
# - Monitor memory usage with very wide datasets

# Optimal performance tips:
# - Ensure categorical variables are factors
# - Use meaningful factor level ordering
# - Remove unnecessary columns from data
# - Balance detail with readability
```

## Interpretation Guidelines

### What River Plots Reveal

```{r interpretation-guide}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# River plots effectively show:
# 1. Transition patterns: How categories change over time
# 2. Flow volumes: Relative sizes of different pathways
# 3. Stability: Which categories remain constant
# 4. Convergence: Multiple paths leading to same outcome
# 5. Divergence: Single starting points leading to multiple outcomes

# Key interpretation elements:
# - Stream width = quantity/frequency
# - Stream color = category grouping (based on fillType)
# - Node height = total volume at that stage
# - Flow crossings = category transitions
```

### Common Patterns

```{r common-patterns}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Clinical research patterns:

# Treatment response progression:
# - Stable flows: Consistent responders
# - Improving flows: Treatment success
# - Declining flows: Treatment failure
# - Complex flows: Mixed responses

# Patient journey analysis:
# - Funnel patterns: Progressive selection
# - Retention patterns: Stable participation
# - Dropout patterns: Loss to follow-up
# - Recovery patterns: Improvement over time
```

## Comparison with Other Visualizations

### When to Use River Plots vs Alternatives

```{r visualization-comparison}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Use river plots when:
# - Tracking categorical changes over time
# - Showing flow volumes and transitions
# - Multiple pathways need visualization
# - Process or journey analysis required

# Use line plots when:
# - Continuous variables over time
# - Trends and patterns are focus
# - Statistical relationships important
# - Precise values needed

# Use bar charts when:
# - Single time point comparisons
# - Exact values are important
# - Categories don't flow/transition
# - Simple frequency distributions

# Use heatmaps when:
# - Showing correlation patterns
# - Matrix-style data relationships
# - Intensity rather than flow important
# - Compact representation needed
```

## Conclusion

The optimized `jjriverplot` function provides:

- **Comprehensive flow visualization**: Multiple plot types for different analytical needs
- **High performance**: Significant speed improvements through caching
- **Clinical relevance**: Designed for healthcare pathway and outcome analysis  
- **Flexibility**: Extensive customization options for publication and presentation
